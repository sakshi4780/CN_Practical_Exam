Ques 1
Simulate Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error Detection Algorithm For Noisy Channel.


Ans


A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detection code that is extensively used in digital networks and storage devices to detect unintentional data changes. A short check value is applied to blocks of data entering these systems, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents.

The calculation is performed upon retrieval, and if the check values do not match, corrective action against data corruption can be done.

Ques 2 

Simulate and Implement Selective repeat Window protocol


Ans


Selective Repeat protocol or SR protocol is an implementation of a sliding window protocol

1.In SR protocol, sender window size is always same as receiver window size.  


2.SR protocol uses independent acknowledgements only.


3.SR protocol does not accept the corrupted frames but does not silently discard them.


4.SR protocol accepts the out of order frames.


5.SR protocol requires sorting at the receiver’s side.


6.SR protocol requires searching at the sender’s side.
